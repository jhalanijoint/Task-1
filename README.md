Ethereum is a public blockchain that facilitates open participation with decentralized PoS consensus. It focuses on trustless smart contract execution using Solidity, albeit with less throughput (~15–30 TPS) due to complete decentralization. This allows it to be used for developing decentralized applications (DApps) such as DeFi or NFTs where public verification is essential.

Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain with modular consensus (Raft being default). It achieves high throughput (~1,000+ TPS) and supports smart contracts in general-purpose languages like Go or Java. Its architecture includes private channels, enabling confidential transactions among select parties — perfect for supply chain systems where privacy and performance matter.

R3 Corda : Intended for consortiums, specializes primarily on legal enforcement of contracts and point-to-point messaging. No native token but does support highly sophisticated financial workflows via smart contracts written in Kotlin. Design is privacy-centric and appropriate for regulated frameworks like interbank applications.

Platform Choice :

DApp: Ethereum (open access, big community, native token).

Supply Chain: Hyperledger Fabric (high throughput, private channels).

Inter-bank Financial App: R3 Corda (Privacy, Compliance, and financial logic support).
